# MadLib-game
 i created a MadLib game. If you're unfamiliar MadLibs are where the player blindly provides different words (verbs, adjectives, etc.) and then the words are placed into a sentence. Usually the sentence comes out pretty absurd, which is the fun!

The MadLib may be "<name> went to the store to buy <noun>." The user does not see the MadLib, but is instead prompted to provide a name and a noun. Then the user is show the sentence with their provided words. If the user gave "Carrie" and "ice cream" the sentence would now be "<Carrie> went to the store to buy <ice cream>."
 
 Program reads MadLib prompts from a file: MadLib Sentences.txt 
Program will randomly choose one sentence to use as the prompt.
The program will parse what special words the user must enter.
For the previous example this would be "name" and "noun".
The program prompts the user to enter those special words and stores them.
The program displays the full MadLib sentence with the special words replaced with the user's words.
